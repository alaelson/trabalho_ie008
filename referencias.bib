  Abstract                 = {In this paper, quality of transmission (QoT)-aware lightpath provisioningschemes for transparent optical networks are proposed and assessed. The mainidea is to overcome lightpath blocking due to excessive physical impairments(i.e., unacceptable QoT) by means of successive lightpath set up attemptsperformed by generalized multiprotocol label switching (GMPLS) signaling protocolalong alternate routes. The schemes are enabled by the introduction into currentGMPLS signaling protocol \[i.e., resource reservation protocol with trafficengineering (RSVP-TE)\] of extensions which encompass the QoT parameters thatcharacterize the optical layer. Differently from previous approaches, theproposed GMPLS-based schemes are still distributed but they do not imply theintroduction of additional extensions into the routing protocol (e.g., OSPF-TE).The QoT-aware provisioning schemes are first validated by simulationsperformed on a WDM mesh network. Results show that only few successive setup attempts are required to complete the lightpath establishment. In addition,an experimental demonstration where the proposed RSVP-TE extensions are implementedin the control plane of a transparent metro network is reported showing thatimpairment-aware lightpath provisioning is achieved on a time scale of fewmilliseconds.},
