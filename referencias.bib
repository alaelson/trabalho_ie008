  abstract = {In this paper, quality of transmission (QoT)-aware lightpath provisioningschemes
	for transparent optical networks are proposed and assessed. The mainidea
	is to overcome lightpath blocking due to excessive physical impairments(i.e.,
	unacceptable QoT) by means of successive lightpath set up attemptsperformed
	by generalized multiprotocol label switching (GMPLS) signaling protocolalong
	alternate routes. The schemes are enabled by the introduction into
	currentGMPLS signaling protocol \[i.e., resource reservation protocol
	with trafficengineering (RSVP-TE)\] of extensions which encompass
	the QoT parameters thatcharacterize the optical layer. Differently
	from previous approaches, theproposed GMPLS-based schemes are still
	distributed but they do not imply theintroduction of additional extensions
	into the routing protocol (e.g., OSPF-TE).The QoT-aware provisioning
	schemes are first validated by simulationsperformed on a WDM mesh
	network. Results show that only few successive setup attempts are
	required to complete the lightpath establishment. In addition,an
	experimental demonstration where the proposed RSVP-TE extensions
	are implementedin the control plane of a transparent metro network
	is reported showing thatimpairment-aware lightpath provisioning is
	achieved on a time scale of fewmilliseconds.},
