The growth in the clients numbers of communication services combined with the user behavior change, who demands
higher transmission rates, high quality services and access mobility, has taken to the accelerated growth in data traffic in the communication systems . It is necessary at this point, the continuous development of optical
communication technologies, transport protocols, efficient network control, beside resilience techniques e reports fails. In this work, it is presented the optical network transport protocols, which has the function of route the
data and transmits it over the physical layer, and also a description of the control planes which act in the management level. It is presented the principal optical transport technologies: Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy
(PDH), Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET), Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH), Optical Transport Network
(OTN). It is also detailed the optical networks control protocols such as Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching
(GMPLS) and Software Defined Networking (SDN). A case study with the application of the concepts related to this
work is reported, showing the applicability of the topics discussed.
